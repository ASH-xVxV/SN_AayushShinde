The Personal Home Cloud is a secure, role-based storage system for families. It provides multi-level access (self, parent, sibling, guest), with files encrypted using Fernet for privacy. A Flask API manages permissions and guest sessions with time limits. Designed for simplicity, security, and extendable remote access.
